# Description

This is a very simple addition to the works of Hause Lin with his Obsidian-Alfred workflow

I've just added the option to copy the corresponding URI link to paste it externally (like into a todo list app or any other place you want). 

That is done by performing any of the five commands, navigating to the desired file and then holding `option` key then `Enter`.

You may find the instructions to to use the five commands `od` `os` `or` and `ot` the original workflow here:

# Known bugs

- Does not work properly if destination file name has accented characters (like ã, é, ï, ô, ú)
